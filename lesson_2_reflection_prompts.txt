What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


git creates a .git directory but it doesn't commit any of the files in the directory.  You need to do this as a first step before committing files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows you to assemble what you want to put in a commit
